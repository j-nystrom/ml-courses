# ml-courses

## Overview of the repository

This repository contains notebooks (mostly assignments but also other code) from various courses on machine learning and data science. These cover data analysis and supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. 

- **data-science-intro**: Course in mathematical statistics and core data science concepts (Uppsala University): probability theory, random variables, concentration and limits, risk, estimation and likelihood, optimization, pseudorandom number generators, Markov chains, pattern recognition, regression. 

- **ml-intro**: Assigments from introductory course in machine learning (Stockholm University). Covers regression (linear regression, KNN and neural networks), unsupervised learning (K means clustering, Gaussian mixtures, PCA and autoencoders) and reinforcement learning.

- **reinforcement-learning**:   

- **statistical-ml**: Statistical machine learning course covering linear regression, classification models (LDA, QDA, KNN), tree based models (decision trees, random forests, bagging) and boosting (Uppsala University).
